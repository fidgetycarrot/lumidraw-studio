# LumiDraw Studio 0.19.1

A responsive Draw Things workspace inside Lumiverse, with Bridge-powered model,
sampler, and LoRA catalogs plus separate Studio and Story workflows.

## 0.19.1 — Truncation recovery and cleaner parser context

- Strips `<scenecard>`, `<adventurecard>`, and similar utility-card blocks from
  current and prior parser prose so UI/state metadata cannot crowd out the
  actual roleplay scene.
- Keeps the nearest configured previous messages while capping their combined
  text, preserving continuity without sending several oversized cards.
- Repairs structured replies that stop inside the final optional key, string,
  or array item by discarding only the unfinished tail and safely closing the
  JSON containers.
- Recovered scenes still pass the normal minimum-scene validation before Draw
  Things can run; malformed or skeletal results remain rejected.
- Tightens optional JSON fields and raises the structured output allowance
  modestly while retaining compact scene extraction.

## 0.19.0 — Persona Library and Appearance States

- Added a reusable **Persona Library** stored independently of Story presets.
- A Story preset can link to one saved persona; edits to that persona apply to
  every linked preset on the next parser run.
- Presets retain a local fallback copy, so deleting a library persona does not
  erase the profile fields already stored in those presets.
- Added **Appearance States / Forms** to character profiles and reusable
  personas. Only one state is injected into an Anima prompt at a time.
- Each state may define recognition phrases, a subject/count override, and
  whether the profile's default outfit is inherited or omitted.
- The structured parser receives the saved state names and may select one with
  `appearance_state` when the current passage or reference context establishes
  it. When uncertain, LumiDraw uses the configured default state.
- Shared identity traits remain in Permanent appearance; state-specific tags
  are appended only for the selected form, preventing Human/Hybrid/Wolf traits
  from being mixed together.
- Retains the 0.18.12 essentials-first parser gate, fully isolated Studio mode,
  remote History delivery, auto-trigger diagnostics, prop locks, and selective
  Anima hybrid prompting.

### Appearance-state line format

One state per line:

```text
Name [count=1boy; outfit=inherit; subject=adult human man] | recognition phrases => appearance tags
```

Example:

```text
Human [count=1boy; outfit=inherit; subject=adult human man] | human form, unshifted => broad shoulders, messy dark brown hair
Hybrid [count=1boy; outfit=inherit; subject=humanoid werewolf] | hybrid form, half-shifted => wolf ears, partial muzzle, furred arms, claws, tail
Wolf [count=1other; outfit=omit; subject=massive wolf] | wolf form, fully shifted, on four paws => dark brown fur, amber eyes, quadruped
```

`outfit=inherit` keeps the profile's default outfit when the scene does not
specify clothing. `outfit=omit` suppresses that fallback, useful for full animal
forms. `count` and `subject` are optional.

## Retained automatic Anima pipeline

This release addresses the case where the full experimental Anima pipeline works
from **Manual Parser** but a completed roleplay response produces no automatic
images. Manual Anima parsing, Legacy instruction-only parsing, context windows,
and Loom ledger continuity remain available.

### Saved-message auto-trigger fan-in

Automatic Parser mode no longer depends on a single XML callback. LumiDraw now
accepts the completed assistant message from several compatible lifecycle paths:

- the saved-message `GENERATION_ENDED` event;
- `CHARACTER_MESSAGE_RENDERED` as a fallback;
- the existing `<lumidraw-parse>` tag interceptor;
- frontend forwarding of the same saved-message events when backend event scope
  is unavailable.

All sources enter one deduplicating queue. A tag callback that arrives first can
be enriched by a later saved-message event carrying the exact chat ID, message
ID, and final content. Only one parser job may be created for that message.

### Exact message targeting and delayed-save recovery

Automatic jobs now:

- fetch the event's explicit chat rather than relying only on the current chat;
- target the exact assistant message ID;
- retry while a newly saved message becomes queryable;
- use final message content as a last-resort identity check;
- allow a later lifecycle event to retry when lookup—not parsing—was the only
  failure.

If another scan already owns the parser/Draw Things lane, an automatic job waits
rather than being silently discarded as `busy`.

### Visible automatic-job diagnostics

The Story panel and Terminal now expose automatic stages including queued,
waiting, parsing, compiling, generating, inserting, generated, skipped, and
error. Expected Terminal lines include:

```text
[lumidraw] documented GENERATION_ENDED auto trigger registered
[lumidraw] auto trigger queued · source=...
[lumidraw] auto trigger deduplicated/enriched · source=...
[lumidraw] story scan stage · parsing ...
[lumidraw] auto scan result · source=...
```

The original event sources are retained in the result log, which makes it clear
whether the tag, frontend event, backend event, or a combination started the
job.

## Anima hybrid refinements

The compiler remains compact and tag-first. Its identifier is now
`anima-hybrid-v7`.

### Generic signature ownership

For multi-subject scenes, one distinctive trait may be moved to the beginning of
its owner's tag block and reinforced with a short generic ownership anchor, for
example:

```text
The elf Sovi is the only subject wearing round glasses.
```

The behavior is profile-driven rather than character-specific. It applies to
traits such as eyewear, pointed ears, horns, wings, tails, visible markings, and
piercings.

### Generic named-prop expansion

A profile mapping such as:

```text
Aegis-fang = single massive warhammer
```

may expand a generic extracted action such as `holds hammer one-handed` into a
more visually useful named-prop sentence and tag phrase. The inference is used
only when one profile alias unambiguously matches the generic object class.

### POV gating

Bare `pov` / `first person view` tags are removed unless a visible persona is
actually represented from the viewer's body or eye position. Normal two-subject
camera compositions retain their other framing tags.

## Parser continuity retained

- Up to four previous messages as reference context; default is two.
- Optional latest `<loomledger>` as attire, accessory, location, state, and prop
  continuity reference.
- Current passage remains the only allowed source of the illustrated action and
  anchor quote.
- Structured JSON truncation repair and per-image output allowances.
- Conditional visible anatomy remains subject-owned and safety-gated.
- Legacy instruction-only Parser remains the known-good fallback.
- Live elapsed timer, Cancel Parser, and four-minute parser timeout.

## Other retained behavior

- User quality tags and negative prompts remain untouched.
- Inline mode remains on the simpler tag-only path.
- Immediate History updates and manual History refresh.
- Old-message rescanning with chat-message and story-message numbering.
- In-app image viewer with zoom, pan, prompt restoration, and reuse.
- Bridge-powered model, sampler, and LoRA catalogs.
- Draw Things `batch_count` is forced to `1`; only the first returned image is
  accepted for each requested illustration.
- Maximum-image limits are enforced before generation.

## Suggested test

1. Confirm the header and Terminal show **v0.19.1**.
2. Select **Parser**, **Anima hybrid experimental**, and enable automatic scans.
3. Leave reference context at **2 previous messages** and Loom ledger on.
4. Complete one new roleplay response without pressing Manual Parser.
5. Confirm Terminal shows an auto trigger, a parser stage, and a final auto scan
   result.
6. If no image is warranted, the Story panel should show that decision rather
   than remaining silent.
7. Run Manual Parser once afterward to compare the same Anima pipeline directly.
